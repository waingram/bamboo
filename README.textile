h1. TCP ingester for project Bamboo

This code takes TCP texts and ingests them into a Fedora repository. 

It creates multiple Fedora objects, one for the book itself and one for each page. 

The book object will have these datastreams:
* Un-Adorned TEI XML
* Adorned TEI XML
* MARC XML 
* Properties 

Page objects will have:
* URL to the page image
